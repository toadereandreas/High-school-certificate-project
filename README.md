# High-school-certificate-project
  This is a project for my high school certificate in computer science. This is an application in C# which uses a database from Microsoft Access. This is an car bussines database management app which allows salesmen to manage their car park, order new models and reserve certain models for different clients. The app is useful for both users and administrator since it has an initial login form and determines via credentials which type of user form to open next.
  More useful information can be found in the Documentation.
